Project Overview: My Chatbot
This project implements a chatbot using the ChatGPT API, leveraging Spring Boot for backend processing and HTML/CSS for the frontend user interface. The chatbot allows users to send and receive messages in real time.

Key Features:
Chat Interface: A responsive HTML interface styled with Tailwind CSS enables users to interact with the chatbot easily. Users can input their messages and view responses in a visually appealing chat window.
Backend Integration: The Spring Boot controller (ChatController) handles chat interactions by utilizing the ChatGPT API. It processes incoming messages through a POST request (/chat) and streams responses via a GET request (/stream), facilitating a smooth conversation flow.
Real-time Messaging: The frontend uses HTMX for asynchronous requests, allowing users to submit messages without page refreshes. Responses from the bot are streamed to the interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
Error Handling: The application includes basic error handling to manage issues during API calls, providing users with feedback if something goes wrong.
Technologies Used:
Spring Boot: For creating RESTful services and managing the chatbot logic.
ChatGPT API: To generate chatbot responses based on user input.
HTML/CSS: For building a user-friendly frontend interface.
HTMX: For enhancing user experience through AJAX-like capabilities without extensive JavaScript.
This project exemplifies the integration of AI with web technologies to create interactive applications, providing users with engaging conversational experiences.
